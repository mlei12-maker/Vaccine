# ML Project - Establish a Pipeline (Vaccine Prediction)
Data and Test Case Description: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/

Initial Goal: Establish a data pipeline that can be customized and extended for other problem

Intermidiate Goal: Use only 1 algorithm to reach at least top 5% in at least 1 real test case without leveraging 3rd-party or public data

End Goal: In addition to intermediate goal, performance is proven stable across different test cases

Optional Goal: Avoid using sklearn or other existing package for feature engineering
